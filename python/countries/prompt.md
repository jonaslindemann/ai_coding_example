# Prompt 1

I want to create a python module countries.py with a class for querying the restcountries.com REST API in a simple way. Use modern Python features. You should be able to query for all countries using a specified list of fields. Get the country information and code.

# Prompt 2

Update the example to only use the client interface.

# Prompt 3

Update the countries module to use properties where it makes most sense.

# Prompt 4

Using this model implement a tabbed user interface in Qt (using pyqt) with the following tabs:

* Country table - Table of all countries searchable and filterable.
* Country by code - Displays country information based on country code.
* Country by name - Where you can search for a specific country and get a detailed list of country information.

Use the countries module and create a separate module for the user interface. 

# Prompt 5

Please update the ui code to use qtpy instead of directly referencing PyQt6.

# Prompt 6

Implement a status indicator when the thread is active.
